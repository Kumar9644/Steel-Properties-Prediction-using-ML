# Steel-Properties-Prediction-using-ML
This project is more focused on my domain (Mechanical Engineering). In this project a ML model has been developed to predict the Tensile strength(UTS) of Mild steels. Steel is one of the widely used structural material so, it becomes necessary that we calculate the mechanical properties of steel.
The conventional method is to do a test on on Universal testing Machine but by using this model both time and work force can be reduced. The model takes inputs of the chemical and alloying composition of steel and predicts the Tensile strength of steel at the specified temperature.
PS- Tensile strength is the capacity of the steel to resist any load applied over it.
XGboost gave the least mean squared error.
